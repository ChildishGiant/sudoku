# Sudoku

This is an implementation of [sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) for the fantasy console [TIC-80](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80). If you open up the code there's a bunch of variables at the top that change how the game plays and looks.

TODO:

 - [ ] Settings screen
 - [ ] Sound FX
 - [ ] Music?
